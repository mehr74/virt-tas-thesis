Traditionaly network configuration has been done in a 
box-by-box manner. Therefore, it was a time consuming task,
and there was always the risk of misconfiguration. 

Network virtualization allows for the creation of 
virtual networks, each with independent service model,
topologies and addressing architectures, over the 
same physical network. Creation, configuration, and 
management of these networks is done through a global
abstraction rather than pieced together through box-by-box
configuration.
