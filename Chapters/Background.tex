\section{Network Virtualization}

% The main idea of network virtualization is to separate the 
% control logic of the network (control plane) from the 
% forwarding hardware (data plane)

% Configuring the traditional networks was hard. The challenges.
% include multiple numbers of vendors which provided switches and 
% other hardware providers. For adding or removing a machine, 
% multiple configurations need to be set up.

% SDN has three main components. 
% 1. Interface between applications, and SDN
% 2. Interface between SDN, and different network elements (Open Flow)
% 3. The control logic on the SDN (the brain of the network)

% 2. The most common interfaces used to control switches called 
%    OpenFlow. It has multiple versions and each version added new
%    features

% 3. There are multiple controller proposed
%    3.1 POX is a SDN controller written in python
%    3.2 OpenDayLight is the largest open source SDN.

% We can use mininet to emulate network and demonstrate the use of 
% Software Defined Networking.
